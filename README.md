# Monthly Expenses Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze monthly expenses and explore their relationship with various lifestyle factors. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, hypothesis testing, and statistical modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset contains demographic information such as gender, age, living arrangements, study year, and lifestyle choices like smoking, drinking, and hobbies. It also includes monthly subscription details and monthly expenses.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of expenses, identifying trends and patterns.
- Visualization: Utilizing plots like bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and KDE plots to visualize relationships and insights.
- Statistical Analysis: Conducting hypothesis tests (e.g., ANOVA) to assess the impact of lifestyle factors on expenses.
- Model Building: Using statistical modeling techniques to predict monthly expenses based on lifestyle choices.
